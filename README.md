Home Automation System
Nowadays, people have smartphones with them all the time. So it makes sense to use these to control home appliances.
Presented here is a home automation system using a simple Android app, which you can use to control electrical appliances with clicks or voice commands. Commands are sent via Wifi to Raspberry pi 3 model B. 
So you need not get up to switch on or switch off the device while watching a movie or doing some work.
